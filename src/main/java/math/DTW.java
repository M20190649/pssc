 * @DESCRIPTION Dynamic time warping
 * From wikipedia
 * In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for measuring
 * similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. For instance, similarities
 * in walking could be detected using DTW, even if one person was walking faster than the other,
 * or if there were accelerations and decelerations during the course of an observation.
 * DTW has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data â€” indeed,
 * any data that can be turned into a linear sequence can be analyzed with DTW.
 * A well known application has been automatic speech recognition, to cope with different speaking speeds.
 * Other applications include speaker recognition and online signature recognition.
 * Also it is seen that it can be used in partial shape matching application.
